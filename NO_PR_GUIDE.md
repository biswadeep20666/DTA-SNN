# How to Use This Repository WITHOUT Creating Pull Requests

## Your Question Answered! üéØ

You asked: *"can u explain the repository in simple words without creating pull requests?? how to do that? can u guide me?? i am not looking to open PRs as of now"*

**Great news!** You DON'T need to create pull requests to use this repository! Let me explain...

---

## What ARE Pull Requests (PRs)?

Pull Requests are used when:
- You want to **contribute changes back** to the original repository
- You've **modified the code** and want the authors to review it
- You want to **suggest improvements** to the project
- You're **collaborating with others** on the codebase

---

## What You Probably Want to Do (No PRs Needed!)

Most likely, you want to:
1. ‚úÖ **Learn** how the code works
2. ‚úÖ **Train models** on your datasets
3. ‚úÖ **Experiment** with parameters
4. ‚úÖ **Use the code** for your research/project
5. ‚úÖ **Test** the DTA-SNN approach

**None of these require pull requests!** You can do all of this locally on your machine.

## Simple Guide: Use This Repository (Without PRs)

### Step 1: Get a Copy of the Code

**Option A: Download ZIP (Easiest)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/biswadeep20666/DTA-SNN
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file on your computer
5. Done! You have the code.

**Option B: Clone with Git**
```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/biswadeep20666/DTA-SNN.git

# Go into the directory
cd DTA-SNN
```

**That's it!** Now you have a complete copy of the code on your computer.

---

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

Install the required packages:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use the Docker container (if you prefer)
docker-compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yaml up -d
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Code Locally

```bash
# Train on CIFAR-10 (easiest dataset to start with)
bash ./scripts/run_cifar10.sh

# Or run manually with custom parameters
python main.py --DS cifar10 --epochs 250 --batch_size 64
```

**Important:** Everything runs on YOUR computer. Nothing is sent back to GitHub. No PRs needed!

---

### Step 4: Experiment Freely!

You can now:

```bash
# Try different datasets
python main.py --DS cifar100 --epochs 250

# Turn DTA on/off to compare
python main.py --DS cifar10 --DTA_ON True --epochs 250
python main.py --DS cifar10 --DTA_ON False --epochs 250

# Adjust parameters
python main.py --DS cifar10 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.05

# Modify the code files directly
# Change models/DTA.py, models/TXA.py, etc.
# Run again to test your changes
```

**All of this is LOCAL.** Your changes stay on your computer!

---

## What You CAN Do Locally (No PRs)

‚úÖ **Modify any code files**
- Change `models/DTA.py` to experiment with attention
- Edit `main.py` to add new features
- Modify training scripts in `scripts/`

‚úÖ **Create new files**
- Add your own dataset loaders
- Create new model architectures
- Write analysis scripts

‚úÖ **Run experiments**
- Train multiple times with different seeds
- Test on different datasets
- Try different hyperparameters

‚úÖ **Save your results**
- Models are saved as `.pth.tar` files locally
- Keep logs of your experiments
- Create your own documentation

‚úÖ **Break things and fix them**
- Experiment freely!
- If something breaks, just re-download the code
- No risk to the original repository

---

## When Would You NEED Pull Requests?

Only if you want to:
- ‚ùå Share your improvements with the original authors
- ‚ùå Fix a bug in the original repository
- ‚ùå Contribute a new feature to the public version
- ‚ùå Collaborate with the repository maintainers

**If you're not doing any of the above, don't worry about PRs!**

## Example Workflow (No PRs Involved)

### Scenario 1: "I just want to train a model"

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/biswadeep20666/DTA-SNN.git
cd DTA-SNN

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run training
bash ./scripts/run_cifar10.sh

# 4. Wait for training to complete
# Model will be saved as: CIFAR10-S42-B64-T6-E250-LR0.1.pth.tar

# Done! No PRs needed.
```

---

### Scenario 2: "I want to experiment with different parameters"

```bash
# Try different learning rates
python main.py --DS cifar10 --learning_rate 0.01 --epochs 100
python main.py --DS cifar10 --learning_rate 0.1 --epochs 100
python main.py --DS cifar10 --learning_rate 0.5 --epochs 100

# Compare results
# All models are saved locally
# No PRs needed!
```

---

### Scenario 3: "I want to modify the code"

```bash
# 1. Open any file in your favorite editor
nano models/DTA.py
# or
vim models/DTA.py
# or use VSCode, PyCharm, etc.

# 2. Make your changes
# For example, change the attention mechanism

# 3. Save the file

# 4. Test your changes
python main.py --DS cifar10 --epochs 10

# 5. If it works, great! If not, keep iterating

# All changes stay on YOUR computer
# No PRs needed!
```

---

### Scenario 4: "I want to use this for my research"

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup (as above)
git clone https://github.com/biswadeep20666/DTA-SNN.git
cd DTA-SNN
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run experiments for your paper
bash ./scripts/run_cifar10.sh
bash ./scripts/run_cifar100.sh

# 3. Collect results, create tables, graphs

# 4. Cite the paper in your work:
# Kim et al., "DTA: Dual Temporal-Channel-Wise Attention 
# for Spiking Neural Networks", WACV 2025

# That's it! No PRs needed.
```

## Understanding Git (Without PRs)

If you cloned with Git, you might see messages like:
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'
```

**Don't worry!** This is just Git tracking the original repository. You can:

```bash
# See what files you've changed
git status

# See the changes you made
git diff

# Save your changes locally (optional)
git add .
git commit -m "My experiments"

# But you DON'T push to GitHub
# (Don't run: git push)
```

**Key point:** 
- `git commit` = Save changes **locally** (on your computer) ‚úÖ
- `git push` = Send changes **to GitHub** (creates potential for PRs) ‚ùå

Just don't do `git push` and you'll never create a PR!

## FAQ

### Q: I changed the code. Will it affect the original repository?
**A:** No! Your changes are only on your computer. The original repository is safe.

### Q: I want to share my changes with friends. Do I need a PR?
**A:** No! Just share your modified files with them directly (email, USB drive, etc.). Or create your own GitHub repository for your version.

### Q: What if I want to keep my version updated with the original?
**A:** If you used Git to clone:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
This downloads new changes from the original repository without creating a PR.

### Q: I accidentally created a PR. What do I do?
**A:** Go to the PR on GitHub and click "Close pull request". No harm done!

### Q: Can I delete my local copy and start over?
**A:** Yes! Just delete the folder and re-download/clone. Fresh start!

### Q: Should I create a branch?
**A:** Only if you want to organize your experiments locally. Branches are still local and don't require PRs.

## Still Confused?

Think of it like downloading a game or app:
- **Download the app** = Clone the repository
- **Play the game** = Run the code
- **Modify settings** = Change parameters
- **Create custom levels** = Modify the code

You can do ALL of this without telling the game developer!

**Pull requests** = "Hey developer, I made a cool level, want to include it in the official game?"

If you're not trying to contribute to the "official game", you don't need PRs!

---

## Bottom Line

**Question:** "How do I use this repository without creating PRs?"

**Answer:** Just download/clone it and use it! Everything you do stays on your computer unless you explicitly push to GitHub. PRs are for contributing back, not for using the code.

**You're good to go! üöÄ**

Happy coding! If you have more questions about how the code works (not about PRs), check the other guide files!
